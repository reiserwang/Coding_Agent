# Product Guidelines - AI Agent Framework

## Documentation Style
- **Detailed & Explanatory:** Documentation should provide a deep understanding of the "why" behind architectural decisions and workflows. We prioritize clarity and depth to ensure users can adapt the framework effectively.
- **Action-Oriented:** We focus on practical, "How-To" guides and real-world examples. Documentation is successful if a user can immediately apply a concept to their workflow.

## Code Presentation
- **Snippet-Focused:** When presenting code, we prioritize brevity and relevance. We highlight the specific logic or changes being discussed rather than providing voluminous, unrelated context.

## Visual Identity & Formatting
- **Mermaid Diagrams:** We use Mermaid.js charts as the primary way to visualize agent flows, system architecture, and complex decision trees.
- **Markdown Tables:** Tables are our preferred method for organizing and comparing structured data, such as tool capabilities, skill definitions, or agent roles.

## Terminology & Onboarding
- **Contextual Definitions:** To ensure accessibility without interrupting flow, we explain technical terms and project-specific jargon (e.g., "Ralph Wiggum", "Orchestrator Pattern") the first time they appear in each document.

## Agent Personality & Tone
- **Helpful & Proactive:** Agents should behave as expert assistants who anticipate needs and suggest logical next steps rather than waiting for explicit instructions.
- **Transparent & Analytical:** Agents must be vocal about their thought processes. They should clearly state their strategy and proactively identify potential risks or trade-offs in their proposed solutions.
