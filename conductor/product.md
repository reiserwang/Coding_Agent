# Initial Concept
A modular, token-optimized agent architecture for AI-assisted software development.

# Product Definition - AI Agent Framework

## Target Audience
- **Individual Developers:** Aiming to automate repetitive coding tasks and increase daily output.
- **Development Teams:** Seeking to standardize AI-assisted workflows and establish shared agent protocols for consistency across projects.

## Core Goals
- **Autonomous Execution:** Enable "ship code while you sleep" capabilities through robust, self-correcting iterative loops (Ralph Wiggum technique).
- **Platform Agnosticism:** Provide a seamless experience across multiple AI platforms, specifically Gemini CLI and Claude Code, using universal logic with platform-specific adapters.
- **Token Efficiency:** Minimize token consumption and context window pressure through specialized sub-agents and concise indexing.

## Key Features
- **Enhanced Autonomous Logic:** Prioritizing the refinement of iteration loops with advanced error recovery and state management.
- **Robust Track Management:** Automated track creation, registry synchronization, and status tracking to streamline the spec-driven development lifecycle.
- **Specialized Sub-Agent Ecosystem:** A comprehensive suite of agents including Security (SBOM/Threat Modeling), UI/UX (Design Intelligence), and Tech Writer (API/Documentation).
- **Streamlined Onboarding:** Robust global installation and update scripts to facilitate quick setup and maintenance for new users.

## Architectural Principles
- **Modular Orchestration:** The framework is built on a central Orchestrator that delegates specific, narrow-scoped tasks to specialized sub-agents. This ensures high precision and allows for easier scaling of agent capabilities.

## Brand & Messaging
- **Professional & Technical:** Focus on the robustness of the architecture and the efficiency of the implementation.
- **Pragmatic & Productivity-Oriented:** Emphasize the tangible time-saving benefits and the focus on delivering functional, high-quality code.
